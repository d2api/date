the goal is to make a simple discord bot possible in about as much time as it takes to type `npm install now-answer-me`

```js
import { addCommand, init } from "now-answer-me";

addCommand({ command: "hello", response: 'hi!' });

init("smIcXn83zPK.1FEzAIM0GzMINbgJ1zeM1cNWzANOLT6NDVzZ50I9eY.l85E");
```
